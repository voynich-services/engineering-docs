# Your First Feature

Now that you've successfully launched the project and fixed the initial bugs, it's time to get your hands dirty with real development.

This task is designed to help you get familiar with the codebase and contribute in a meaningful but guided way.

## Objective

You will implement a **new feature** that connects the backend and frontend. This will help you:

- Navigate and extend both FastAPI (backend) and React (frontend) codebases.
- Work with MongoDB data models.
- Write clean, modular code following existing conventions.

## How to Pick Your Feature

Ask your mentor or project lead to assign you a feature or choose one from this starter list:

### Example Feature Ideas

- Add a new endpoint to get a random quote.
- Add pagination to the quotes list.
- Show the author's biography on the author detail page.
- Filter quotes by tag.
- Add a search bar to find quotes by keyword.
- Add a loading state while data is being fetched in the frontend.

Your feature should:

- Touch both the backend and the frontend.
- Include basic error handling.
- Include simple validation if relevant.

## Development Tips

- Stick to existing project structure.
- Read the existing code to see naming conventions and best practices.
- Use `.env` for any config values (don’t hardcode URLs or secrets).
- Use debugging tools to test your changes.

## Code Quality Expectations

Follow our clean code guidelines:

- Meaningful names for variables and functions.
- Small, composable functions.
- Minimal duplication.
- Clear and readable logic.
- Remove unused code, logs, or comments before committing.

<!-- The chapter titled [Clean Code Guidelines](./06-Clean-Code-Guidelines.md) will walk you through these expectations in detail. -->

## When You're Done

1. Test everything works from both frontend and backend.
2. Push your branch.
3. Share with your mentor the link of your branch.

Remember: this is **your sandbox** — no pressure. The goal is to learn how real-world projects are structured and how to work with full-stack systems.
