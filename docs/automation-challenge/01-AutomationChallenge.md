# 🤖 Automation Challenge

Welcome! You'll spend 2-3 days working on an automation challenge to practice Python automation skills before diving into the main internship project.

---

## 🎯 Challenge Overview

**Goal:** Find a manual business process and automate it with Python

**Duration:** 2-3 days

---

## ⚠️ Project Restrictions

### Do NOT Build:

- ❌ **Invoice processing automation**
- ❌ **Chatbot/RAG systems**  
- ❌ **Resume matching with job offers**

> **Why?** These are your main internship projects. Practice on something else first!

---

## ✅ What to Build

### Good Automation Targets:

- **Time-consuming:** Takes X+ minutes manually
- **Repetitive:** Done daily/weekly
- **Rule-based:** No human judgment needed
- **Error-prone:** Manual data entry, copying between systems

### Research Sources:
- Reddit: `r/entrepreneur`, `r/smallbusiness`
- LinkedIn discussions about business pain points
- Ask friends/family about repetitive work tasks
- Observe inefficiencies in businesses you visit

---
